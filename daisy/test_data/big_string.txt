This is a sample string of more than 1024 bytes. This is intended to test if a
string can actually fit a metadata parameter, which cannot be bigger than 1024
bytes.
Wow, 1024 bytes is actually a very long string, much longer than I thought!.
Let's see how long is this now... 275?! You gotta be kidding me. I need at 4
times that!
Ok then... let's multiply this:
