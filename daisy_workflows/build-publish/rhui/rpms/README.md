## RHUI Client configuration RPMs

These RPMs are typically generated by tooling built into the rhui-manager tool. This directory contains the
intermediate generated spec and repo files, entitlement certificate and the extensions.txt used to indicate
the specific entitlements. We have modified the repo files to remove the CA certificate, as our RHUI
endpoint uses TLS certificates from our public CA rather than self-signed.

These RPMs are rarely built and so not set up for our automated package building as we have no need for
version management and tracking. The build steps are nonetheless captured here in a script based on our
package builder. The main additional step is the entitlement key is downloaded from secret storage during the
build process and included in the final RPM.

Currently we have the following RHUI client configuration RPMs, one for each RHEL SKU supported on GCP:

* google-rhui-client-rhel7
* google-rhui-client-rhel7-sap
* google-rhui-client-rhel79-sap
* google-rhui-client-rhel8
* google-rhui-client-rhel8-sap

## Building packages

Typically packages are built using `rhui-manager` by first generating an entitlement cert, then an RPM
containing it:

1. rhui-manager client cert --name google-rhui-client-rhel8-sap --days 10000 --dir $PWD --repo\_label
   repo,repo,repo

1. rhui-manager client rpm --rpm\_name google-rhui-client-rhel8-sap --dir $build\_dir --private\_key
   google-rhui-client-rhel8-sap.key --entitlement\_cert google-rhui-client-rhel8-sap.crt --rpm\_version 4.0


The files in this repo are outputs from both of these commands, and a `build.sh` script which will build the
RPMs without `rhui-manager`.
