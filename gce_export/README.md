## Compute Engine Image Export

The `gce_export` tool streams a local disk to a Google Compute Engine image 
file in a Google Cloud Storage bucket (steps 9 and 10 in the
[image export documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/export-image)).
No local file is created so no additional disk space needs to be allocated. 
Once complete the image file can be imported in GCE as described in the 
[image import documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/import-existing-image).

### Build
Download and install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install). Then pull and 
install the `gce_export` tool, this should place the binary in the 
[Go bin directory](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH):

```
go get github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/compute-image-tools/gce_export
```

### Flags

+ `-disk` disk to copy, on linux this would be something like `/dev/sdb`, and on
Windows `\\.\PhysicalDrive1`
+ `-gcs_path` GCS path to upload the image to, in the form of gs://my-bucket/image.tar.gz
+ `-oauth` path to oauth json file fo authenticating to the GCS bucket
+ `-licenses` (optional) comma separated list of licenses to add to the image
+ `-y` skip confirmation prompt

### Usage

While you can export a disk with currently mounted partitions, or even the disk
containing the current root partition it is recommended to unmount all partitions
prior to running `gce_export`.

#### Linux:

This will stream `/dev/sdb` to the GCS path gs://some-bucket/linux.tar.gz

```
gce_export -disk /dev/sdb -gcs_path gs://some-bucket/linux.tar.gz
```

#### Windows:

This will stream `\\.\PhysicalDrive1` to the GCS path
gs://some-bucket/path/windows.tar.gz

```
gce_export.exe -disk \\.\PhysicalDrive1 gs://some-bucket/windows.tar.gz
```
