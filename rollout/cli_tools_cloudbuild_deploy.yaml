# Deploy given tools to given locations. Expect 2 vars substitutions, examples:
# 1. $_REGIONS="us;us-east1;us-east2"
# 2. $_TOOLS="gve_vm_image_import;gce_vm_image_export"
# The script will pull the built docker images from gcr.io (container registry),
# and then push to artifacts registry (e.g. us-east1-docker.pkg.dev/compute-image-tools/wrappers/gce_vm_image_import)
# with 3 tags: the workflow execution ID, the commit SHA, and the "release".
# 1. The workflow execution ID is used to track which workflow produced the image.
# It's specifically useful when the original workflow was failed and we resumed it.
# 2. The commit SHA is used to track which version of source code produced the image.
# 3. The "release" tag marks it as the current effective image.
