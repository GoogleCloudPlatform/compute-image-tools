# Docs

This folder is for documentation. Markdown files stored here are automatically
converted into webpages on our [GitHub Pages
site](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/compute-image-tools/). For an intro
to GitHub Pages, see [What is GitHub
Pages?](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/) and other
documentation on [help.github.com](https://help.github.com).

Currently we are simply putting all of our documentation files into the root of
this folder. Eventually, we may consider taking advantage of Jekyll's features
by creating a `_posts` folder, a `_config.yml` file, etc.
