## Workflows

A workflow is described by a JSON config file and contains information for the
workflow's steps, step dependencies, GCE/GCP/GCS credentials/configuration,
and file resources. The config has the following fields (**NOTE: all workflow
and step field names are case-insensitive, but we suggest upper camel case.**):

| Field Name | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| Name | string | The name of the workflow. Must be between 1-20 characters and match regex **[a-z]\([-a-z0-9]\*[a-z0-9])?**|
| Project | string | The GCE and GCS API enabled GCP project in which to run the workflow, if no project is given and Daisy is running on a GCE instance, that instance's project will be used. |
| Zone | string | The GCE zone in which to run the workflow, if no zone is given and Daisy is running on a GCE instance, that instance's zone will be used. |
| OAuthPath | string | A local path to JSON credentials for your Project. These credentials should have full GCE permission and read/write permission to GCSPath. If credentials are not provided here, Daisy will look for locally cached user credentials such as are generated by `gcloud init`. |
| GCSPath | string | Daisy will use this location as scratch space and for logging/output results, if no GCSPath is given and Daisy will create a bucket to use in the project, subsequent runs will reuse this bucket. **NOTE**: Your workflow VMs need access to this location, use a bucket in the same project that you will launch instances in or grant your Project's default service account read/write permissions.|
| Sources | map[string]string | A map of destination paths to local and GCS source paths. These sources will be uploaded to a subdirectory in GCSPath. The sources are referenced by their key name within the workflow config. See [Sources](#sources) below for more information. |
| Vars | map[string]string | A map of key value pairs. Vars are referenced by "${key}" within the workflow config. Caution should be taken to avoid conflicts with [autovars](#autovars). |
| Steps | map[string]Step | A map of step names to Steps. See [Steps](#steps) below for more information. |
| Dependencies | map[string]list(string) | A map of step names to a list of step names. This defines the dependencies for a step. Example: a step "foo" has dependencies on steps "bar" and "baz"; the map would include "foo": ["bar", "baz"]. |

Example workflow config:
```json
{
  "Name": "my-wf",
  "Project": "my-project",
  "Zone": "us-central1-f",
  "OAuthPath": "path/to/my/creds.json",
  "GCSPath": "gs://my-bucket/some/path/",
  "Sources": {
    "foo": "local/path/to/file1",
    "bar": "gs://gcs/path/to/file2"
  },
  "Vars": {
    "step1": "step1 name",
    "step2": "step2 name"
  },
  "Steps": {
    "${step1}": ...,
    "${step2}": ...,
    "step3 name": ...
  },
  "Dependencies": {
    "${step2}": ["${step1}"],
    "step3-name": ["${step2}"]
  }
}
```

### Sources

Daisy will upload any workflow sources to the sources directory in GCS
prior to running the workflow. The `Sources` field in a workflow
JSON file is a map of 'destination' to 'source' file. Sources can be a local
or GCS file or directory. Directories will be recursively copied into
destination. The GCS path for the sources directory is available via the
[Autovar](#autovars) `${SOURCESPATH}`.

In this example, the local file `./path/to/startup.sh` will be copied to
`startup.sh` in the sources directory. Similarly, the GCS file
`gs://my-bucket/some/path/install.py` will be copied to `install.py`.
The contents of paths referencing directories like
`./path/to/drivers_folder` and  `gs://my-bucket/my-files` will be
recursively copied to the directories `drivers` and `files` in GCS
respectively.

```json
"Sources": {
  "startup.sh": "./path/to/startup.sh",
  "install.py": "gs://my-bucket/some/path/install.py",
  "drivers": "./path/to/drivers_folder",
  "files": "gs://my-bucket/my-files"
}
```

### Steps

The `Steps` field is a named set of executable steps. It is a map of
a step's name to the step's type and configuration. Step names must begin with
a letter and only contain letters, numbers and hyphens.

For each individual 'step', you set one 'step type' and the type's
associated fields. You may optionally set a step timeout using
`Timeout`. `Timeout` uses [Golang's time.Duration string
format](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration.String) and defaults
to "10m" (10 minutes). As with workflow fields, step field names are
case-insensitive, but we suggest upper camel case.

This example has steps named "step 1" and "step 2". "step 1" has a type
of "<STEP 1 TYPE>" and a timeout of 2 hours. "step2" has a type of
"<STEP 2 TYPE>" and a timeout of 10 minutes, by default.
```json
"Steps": {
  "step1": {
    "<STEP 1 TYPE>": {
      ...
    },
    "Timeout": "2h"
  },
  "step2": {
    "<STEP 2 TYPE>": {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

#### Type: AttachDisks
Not implemented yet.

#### Type: CreateDisks
Creates GCE disks. A list of GCE Disk resources. See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/disks for
the Disk JSON representation. Daisy uses the same representation with a few modifications:

| Field Name | Type | Description of Modification |
| - | - | - |
| Name | string | If RealName is unset, the **literal** disk name will have a generated suffix for the running instance of the workflow. |
| SourceImage | string | Either image [partial URLs](#glossary-partialurl) or workflow-internal image names are valid. |
| Type | string | *Optional.* Defaults to "pd-standard". Either disk type [partial URLs](#glossary-partialurl) or disk type names are valid. |

Added fields:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Project | string | *Optional.* Defaults to workflow's Project. The GCP project in which to create the disk. |
| Zone | string | *Optional.* Defaults to workflow's Zone. The GCE zone in which to create the disk. |
| NoCleanup | bool | *Optional.* Defaults to false. Set this to true if you do not want Daisy to automatically delete this disk when the workflow terminates. |
| RealName | bool | *Optional.* If set Daisy will use this as the resource name instead generating a name. **Be advised**: this circumvents Daisy's efforts to prevent resource name collisions. |

Example: the first is a standard PD disk created from a source image, the second
is a blank PD SSD.
```json
"step-name": {
  "CreateDisks": [
    {
      "Name": "disk1",
      "SourceImage": "projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-8"
    },
    {
      "Name": "disk2",
      "SizeGb": "200",
      "Type": "pd-ssd"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Type: CreateImages
Creates GCE images. A list of GCE Image resources. See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/images for
the Image JSON representation. Daisy uses the same representation with a few modifications:

| Field Name | Type | Description of Modification |
| - | - | - |
| Name | string | If RealName is unset, the **literal** image name will have a generated suffix for the running instance of the workflow. |
| RawDisk.Source | string | Either a GCS Path or a key from Sources are valid. |
| SourceDisk | string | Either disk [partial URLs](#glossary-partialurl) or workflow-internal disk names are valid. |
| SourceImage | string | Either image [partial URLs](#glossary-partialurl) or workflow-internal image names are valid. |

`RawDisk.Source`, `SourceDisk`, and `SourceImage` all set the image's source.
For this reason, they are mutually exclusive; only one should be present in a
`CreateImages` step.

Added fields:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Project | string | *Optional.* Defaults to the workflow Project. The GCP project in which to create this image. |
| GuestOsFeatures | []string] | *Optional.* Along with the GCE JSON API's more complex object structure, Daisy allows the use of a simple list. |
| NoCleanup | bool | *Optional.* Defaults to false. Set this to true if you do not want Daisy to automatically delete this image when the workflow terminates. |
| RealName | bool | *Optional.* If set Daisy will use this as the resource name instead generating a name. **Be advised**: this circumvents Daisy's efforts to prevent resource name collisions. |

This CreateImages example creates an image from a source disk.
```json
"step-name": {
  "CreateImages": [
    {
      "Name": "image1",
      "SourceDisk": "disk2",
      "GuestOsFeatures": ["Feature1", "Feature2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

This CreateImages example creates three images. `image1` is created from
a source from the workflow's `Sources` and will not be cleaned up by
Daisy. `image2` is created from a source from a GCS Path and will use
`my-image2` as the resource name. Lastly, `image3` is created from a disk from
the workflow and will be created in a different project from the
workflow's specified Project.
```json
"step-name": {
  "CreateImages": [
    {
      "Name": "image1",
      "RawDisk": {
        "Source": "my-source"
      },
      "NoCleanup": true
    },
    {
      "Name": "image2",
      "RawDisk": {
        "Source": "gs://my-bucket/image.tar.gz"
      },
      "RealName": "my-image2"
    },
    {
      "Name": "image3",
      "SourceDisk": "my-disk",
      "Project": "my-other-project"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Type: CreateInstances
Creates GCE instances. A list of GCE Instance resources. See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/instances for
the Instance JSON representation. Daisy uses the same representation with a few modifications:

| Field Name | Type | Description of Modification |
| - | - | - |
| Name | string | If RealName is unset, the **literal** instance name will have a generated suffix for the running instance of the workflow. |
| Disks[].Boot | bool | *Now unused.* First disk automatically has boot = true. All others are set to false. |
| Disks[].InitializeParams.DiskType | string | *Optional.* Will prepend "projects/PROJECT/zones/ZONE/diskTypes/" as needed. This allows user to provide "pd-ssd" or "pd-standard" as the DiskType. |
| Disks[].InitializeParams.SourceImage | string | Either image [partial URLs](#glossary-partialurl) or workflow-internal image names are valid. |
| Disks[].Mode | string | *Now Optional.* Now defaults to "READ_WRITE". |
| Disks[].Source | string | Either disk [partial URLs](#glossary-partialurl) or workflow-internal disk names are valid. |
| MachineType | string | *Now Optional.* Now defaults to "n1-standard-1". Either machine type [partial URLs](#glossary-partialurl) or machine type names are valid. |
| Metadata | map[string]string | *Optional.* Instead of the GCE JSON API's more complex object structure, Daisy uses a simple key-value map. Daisy will provide metadata keys `daisy-logs-path`, `daisy-outs-path`, and `daisy-sources-path`. |
| NetworkInterfaces[] | list | *Now Optional.* Now defaults to `[{"network": "global/networks/default", "accessConfigs": [{"type": "ONE_TO_ONE_NAT"}]}`. |
| NetworkInterfaces[].Network | string | Either network [partial URLs](#glossary-partialurl) or workflow-internal network names are valid. |
| NetworkInterfaces[].AccessConfigs[] | list | *Now Optional.* Now defaults to `[{"type": "ONE_TO_ONE_NAT}]`. |

Added fields:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Scopes | list(string) | *Optional.* Defaults to `["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only"]`. Only used if serviceAccounts is not used. Sets default service account scopes by setting serviceAccounts to `[{"email": "default", "scopes": <value of Scopes>}]`. For example, if you wanted to give the default service account read-write access to GCS (see https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#oauth-scopes), you'd use `["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_write"]`. |
| StartupScript | string | *Optional.* A source file from Sources. If provided, metadata will be set for `startup-script-url` and `windows-startup-script-url`.|
| Project | string | *Optional.* Defaults to workflow's Project. The GCP project in which to create the disk. |
| Zone | string | *Optional.* Defaults to workflow's Zone. The GCE zone in which to create the disk. |
| NoCleanup | bool | *Optional.* Defaults to false. Set this to true if you do not want Daisy to automatically delete this disk when the workflow terminates. |
| RealName | bool | *Optional.* If set Daisy will use this as the resource name instead generating a name. **Be advised**: this circumvents Daisy's efforts to prevent resource name collisions. |

This CreateInstances step example creates an instance with two attached
disks, with machine type n1-standard-4, and with metadata "key" = "value".
The instance will have default scopes and will be attached to the default
network.
```json
"step-name": {
  "CreateInstances": [
    {
      "Name": "instance1",
      "Disks": [
        {"Source": "disk1"},
        {"Source": "zones/foo/disks/disk2", "Mode": "READ_ONLY"}
      ],
      "MachineType": "n1-standard-4",
      "Metadata": {"key": "value"}
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Type: CreateNetworks
Creates GCE networks. A list of GCE Network resources. See
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/networks for the Network
JSON representation. Daisy uses the same representation with a few modifications:

| Field Name | Type | Description of Modification |
| - | - | - |
| Name | string | If RealName is unset, the **literal** network name will have a generated suffix for the running instance of the workflow. |

Added fields:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Project | string | *Optional.* Defaults to the workflow Project. The GCP project in which to create this network. |
| NoCleanup | bool | *Optional.* Defaults to false. Set this to true if you do not want Daisy to automatically delete this network when the workflow terminates. |
| RealName | bool | *Optional.* If set Daisy will use this as the resource name instead generating a name. **Be advised**: this circumvents Daisy's efforts to prevent resource name collisions. |

This CreateNetworks example creates a network in the project, `my-other-project`,
with the real name `my-network1`. The network will not be automatically cleaned
up.
```json
"step-name": {
  "CreateNetworks": [
    {
      "Name": "network1",
      "Project": "my-other-project",
      "RealName": "my-network1",
      "NoCleanup": true
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Type: CopyGCSObjects
Copies a GCS files from Source to Destination. Each copy has the following fields:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Source | string | Source path. |
| Destination | list(string) | Destination path. |
| ACLRules | list(ACLRule) | *Optional.* List of ACLRules to apply to the object. |

An ACLRule has two fields:

+ Entity - Refers to a user or group, see entity in https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/objectAccessControls
+ Role - Access level to grant, one of OWNER, READER, or WRITER

This CopyGCSObjects step example copies image.tar.gz from the Daisy OUTSPATH to
gs://project2/my-image.tar.gz and gives the special user "allUsers" read
permissions.
```json
"step-name": {
  "CopyGCSObjects": [
    {
      "Source": "${OUTSPATH}/image.tar.gz",
      "Destination": "gs://project/my-image.tar.gz",
      "AclRules": [{"Entity": "allUsers", "Role": "READER"}]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Type: DeleteResources
Deletes GCE resources (disks, images, instances, networks). Instances are
deleted before all other resources.

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Disks | list(string) | *Optional, but at least one of these fields must be used.* The list of disks to delete. Values can be 1) Names of disks created in this workflow or 2) the [partial URL](#glossary-partialurl) of an existing GCE disk. |
| Images | list(string) | *Optional, but at least one of these fields must be used.* The list of images to delete. Values can be 1) Names of images created in this workflow or 2) the [partial URL](#glossary-partialurl) of an existing GCE image. |
| Instances | list(string) | *Optional, but at least one of these fields must be used.* The list of VM instances to delete. Values can be 1) Names of VMs created in this workflow or 2) the [partial URL](#glossary-partialurl) of an existing GCE VM. |
| Networks | list(string) | *Optional, but at least one of these fields must be used.* The list of networks to delete. Values can be 1) Names of networks created in this workflow or 2) the [partial URL](#glossary-partialurl) of an existing GCE network. |

This DeleteResources step example deletes an image, an instance, and two
disks.
```json
"step-name": {
  "DeleteResources": {
    "Disks":["disk1", "disk2"],
     "Images":["image1"],
     "Instances":["instance1"],
     "Networks":["network1"]
   }
}
```

#### Type: IncludeWorkflow
Includes another Daisy workflow JSON file into this workflow. The included
workflow's steps will run as if they were part of the parent workflow, but
follow the IncludeWorkflow step's dependency map (all steps from an included
workflow also depend on the IncludeWorkflow step's dependencies).

Included workflows have access to all of their parent workflows resources and
vice versa. For example the disk `disk1` created in a previous step will be
available to the included workflow and the instance `instance1` created in the
included workflow will be available to the parent. The included workflow's
Sources are similarly merged with the parent workflow and share the same scratch
directory. The included workflow will not have access to the parent workflows
variables however, all variable substitutions will come from the `Var` field
in the IncludeWorkflow step or from the included workflow's JSON file.

For more information on using IncludeWorkflow, see [Reusing Workflow
Files](daisy-reusing-workflows.md).

IncludeWorkflow step type fields:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Path | string | The local path to the Daisy workflow file to include. |
| Vars | map[string]string | *Optional.* Key-value pairs of variables to send to the included workflow. |

This IncludeWorkflow step example uses a local workflow file and passes a var,
"foo", to the included workflow.
```json
"step-name": {
  "IncludeWorkflow": {
    "Path": "./some_subworkflow.wf.json",
    "Vars": {
        "foo": "bar"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Type: SubWorkflow
Runs a Daisy workflow as a step. The subworkflow will have some fields
overwritten. For example, the subworkflow may specify a GCP Project "foo",
but the parent workflow is working in Project "bar". The subworkflow's Project
will be overwritten so that subworkflow is also running in "bar", the same as
the parent. The fields that get modified by the parent:

* Project (copied from parent)
* Zone (copied from parent)
* GCSPath (changed to a subdirectory in parent's GCSPath)
* OAuthPath (not used, parent workflow's credentials will be used)
* Vars (Vars can be passed in via the SubWorkflow step type Vars field)

The SubWorkflow step type works similarly to the IncludeWorkflow step type,
except that resources (disks, instances, and images) are not shared between the
parent workflow and the subworkflow.

SubWorkflow step type fields:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Path | string | The local path to the Daisy workflow file to run as a subworkflow. |
| Vars | map[string]string | *Optional.* Key-value pairs of variables to send to the subworkflow. Analogous to calling the subworkflow via the commandline with the `-variables foo=bar,baz=gaz` flag. |

This SubWorkflow step example uses a local workflow file and passes a var,
"foo", to the subworkflow.
```json
"step-name": {
  "SubWorkflow": {
    "Path": "./some_subworkflow.wf.json",
    "Vars": {
        "foo": "bar"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Type: WaitForInstancesSignal
Waits for a signal from GCE VM instances. This step will fail if its Timeout
is reached or if a failure signal is received. The wait configuration for each
VM has the following fields:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Name | string | The Name or [partial URL](#glossary-partialurl) of the VM. |
| Interval | string ([Golang's time.Duration format](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration.String)) | The signal polling interval. |
| Stopped | bool | Use the VM stopping as the signal. |
| SerialOutput | SerialOutput (see below) | Parse the serial port output for a signal. |

SerialOutput:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Port | int64 | The serial port number to listen to. GCE VMs have serial ports 1-4. |
| FailureMatch | string | *Optional, but this or SuccessMatch must be provided.* An expected string in case of a failure. |
| SuccessMatch | string | *Optional, but this or FailureMatch must be provided.* An expected string when the VM performed its task successfully. |
| StatusMatch | string | *Optional* An informational status line to print out. |

If any serial line matches FailureMatch, SuccessMatch or StatusMatch the line
from the match onward will be logged. This example step waits for VM "foo" to
stop and for a signal from VM "bar":
```json
"step-name": {
    "WaitForInstancesSignal": [
        {
            "Name": "foo",
            "Stopped": true
        },
        {
            "Name": "bar",
            "SerialOutput": {
                "Port": 1,
                "SuccessMatch": "DasiySuccess:",
                "FailureMatch": "DasiyFailure:",
                "StatusMatch": "DaisyStatus:"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

To output to the serial port from a startup script (launched using the
`StartupScript` field of the `CreateInstances` step type), it is sufficient to
write output to "standard out": On Unix systems this might be using `echo` or
`print`, on Windows `Write-Host` or `Write-Console`.

### Dependencies

The Dependencies map describes the order in which workflow steps will run.
Steps without any dependencies will run immediately, otherwise a step will
only run once its dependencies have completed successfully.

In this example, step1 will run immediately as it has no dependencies, step2
and step3 will run after step1 completes, and step4 will run after step2 and
step3 complete.
```json
{
  "Steps": {
    "step1": {
      ...
    },
    "step2": {
      ...
    },
    "step3": {
      ...
    },
    "step4": {
      ...
    }
  },
  "Dependencies": {
    "step2": ["step1"],
    "step3": ["step1"],
    "step4": ["step2", "step3"]
  }
}
```

### Vars
Vars are a user-provided set of key-value pairs. Vars are used in string
substitutions in the rest of the workflow config using the syntax `${key}`.
Vars can be hardcoded into the workflow config or passed via the commandline.
Vars passed via the commandline will override Vars hardcoded into the Daisy
config.

Vars can be either a simple key:value pairing or with the following fields:
+ Value: (string) value of the variable
+ Description: (string) description of the variable
+ Required: (bool) whether this variable is required to be non empty

A few restrictions on Vars:
* It is best practice to keep vars as lowercase to differentiate them
from [Autovars](#autovars). Furthermore, var key collisions with autovar keys
will cause unexpected results.
* Vars cannot be used to set other vars' keys or values. Attempting to do so
will cause unexpected results.

In this example `var1` is an optional variable with an empty string as the
default value, `var2` is an example of an optional variable with a default
value provided, `var3` is a required variable with no default value. If `var3`
is not set or is set as an empty string the workflow will fail with an error.
```json
{
  "Zone": "${var2}",
  "Vars": {
    "var1": "",
    "var2": {"Value": "foo-zone", "Description": "default zone to run the workflow in"},
    "var3": {"Required": true, "Description": "variable 3"}
  }
}
```
When run, Name will be set to "foo-name" and Zone will be set to "foo-zone".
But, if the user calls Daisy with `daisy wf.json -variables var1=bar-name`,
then Name will be set to "bar-name" and not "foo-name".

#### Autovars
Autovars are used the same as Vars, but are automatically populated by Daisy
out of convenience. Here is the exhaustive list of autovars:

| Autovar key | Description |
| - | - |
| ID | The autogenerated random ID for the current workflow run. |
| NAME | The workflow's Name field. |
| PROJECT | The workflow's Project field. |
| ZONE | The workflow's Zone field. |
| DATE | The date of the current workflow run in YYYYMMDD. |
| DATETIME | The date and time of the current workflow run in YYYYMMDDhhmmss. |
| TIMESTAMP | The Unix epoch of the current workflow run. |
| WFDIR | The directory of the workflow file being run. |
| CWD | The current working directory. |
| GCSPATH | The workflow's GCSPath field. |
| SCRATCHPATH | The scratch subdirectory of GCSPath that the running workflow instance uses. |
| SOURCESPATH | Equivalent to ${SCRATCHPATH}/sources. |
| LOGSPATH | Equivalent to ${SCRATCHPATH}/logs. |
| OUTSPATH | Equivalent to ${SCRATCHPATH}/outs. |
| USERNAME | Username of the user running the workflow. |


#### Source Vars
Any fles set in sources can have their contents injected into a workflow by
using the `SOURCE:my_source` variable. This is useful for embedding a script
or configuration into instance metadata.
```json
{
  "Sources": {
    "my_source.sh": "./path/to/my/source.sh"
  },
  "Steps":  
    "step1": {
      "CreateInstances": [
        {
          "Name": "instance1",
          ...
          "Metadata": {"my-script": "${SOURCE:my_source.sh}"}
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
